## Saving Outputs

**Saving Outputs:** In `Step 4`, choose which results you want to save. Each option represents data for your report. Select an option to save it to your computer for later use. Not selecting an option means it is only available for your current session. This helps optimise memory usage. Choose wisely to make your computer run more efficiently!

## Processing Options

**Process the scenario online:** By default, this option is off. When selected, the scenario is sent to a remote server via the Internet for processing. This enables real-time analysis using the server's resources. It is useful for quick results or complex data that may strain local devices. However, it needs a stable internet connection.
