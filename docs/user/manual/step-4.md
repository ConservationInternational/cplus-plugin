# Step 4 User Manual

1. **Step 4:** `Step 4` guides the user to select the outputs to be saved into the file system for report generation. By clicking on the `Step 4` option, the user will navigate to the section dedicated to producing outputs. Here, the user finds a list of available outputs, each representing data that can be included in the report.

When the user selects an output, it signifies that the user wants it to be saved onto their file system, making it accessible beyond the current session. Conversely, leaving an option unselected means that the data will be stored as a memory layer, useful for temporary use within the current session.

This step is crucial for tailoring the report to include only the necessary information, thereby optimising memory usage. By choosing specific outputs to be saved, the user can generate a concise report that utilises system resources efficiently.

## Select Outputs

There are 5 options available in the select outputs.

1. **NCS With Carbon:** This output is initially unchecked by default. When selected, it triggers the generation of the NCS pathways output, providing insights into the pathways associated with NCS (Natural climate solution) and carbon sequestration.

2. **Landuse Activity:** Initially, this output is checked by default. It generates landuse project layer outputs, providing valuable insights into various landuse activities. Users have the option to uncheck it if they do not wish to include landuse data in the report.

3. **Landuse Activity Normalised:** By default, this output is checked. It generates landuse project normalised outputs, providing a normalised view of landuse activities for enhanced analysis. Users have the option to uncheck it if they do not wish to include landuse normalised data in the report.

4. **Landuse Activity Weighted with PWL (Priority weighted layers):** By default, this output is checked. It generates landuse projects weighted outputs. Unselecting this option will disable report generation this is because the weighted output is the required output for report generation.

5. **Scenario Highest Position analysis:** By default, this output is checked. It generates the final highest position analysis outputs. Unselecting this option will disable report generation this is because the highest position analysis output is the required output for report generation.
