# Step4: Select outputs and processing options

1. **Step 4:** `Step 4` guides the user to select the outputs to be saved into the file system for report generation. By clicking on the `Step 4` option, the user will navigate to the section dedicated to producing outputs. Here, the user finds a list of available outputs, each representing data that can be included in the report.

    When the user selects an output, it signifies that the user wants it to be saved onto their file system, making it accessible beyond the current session. Conversely, leaving an option unselected means that the data will be stored as a memory layer, useful for temporary use within the current session.

    This step is crucial for tailoring the outputs to include only the necessary information, thereby optimising memory usage. By choosing specific outputs to be saved, the user can generate fewer output layers which utilises system resources more efficiently.

    ![Step 4](./img/step-4.png)

2. **Select Outputs**

    There are 5 options available in the select outputs. 

    ![Select options](./img/step-4-1.png)

    **1. NCS With Carbon:** This output is initially unchecked by default. When selected, it triggers the generation of the NCS pathways output, providing insights into the pathways associated with NCS (Natural climate solution) and carbon sequestration.

    **2. Landuse Activity:** Initially, this output is checked by default. It generates landuse activity layer outputs, providing valuable insights into various landuse activities. Users have the option to uncheck it if they do not wish to include landuse data in the report.

    **3. Landuse Activity Normalised:** By default, this output is checked. It generates landuse project normalised outputs, providing a normalised view of landuse activities for enhanced analysis. Users have the option to uncheck it if they do not wish to include landuse normalised data in the report.

    **4. Landuse Activity Weighted with PWL (Priority weighted layers):** By default, this output is checked. It generates landuse projects weighted outputs. Unselecting this option will disable report generation this is because the weighted output is the required output for report generation.

    **5. Scenario Highest Position analysis:** By default, this output is checked. It generates the final highest position analysis outputs. Unselecting this option will disable report generation this is because the highest position analysis output is the required output for report generation.

3. **Processing Options**

    >NOTE: Users need to register and login with a Trends.Earth account to use the online API for processing with CPLUS.

    The user can also choose the processing option, deciding whether they want to process online or offline.

    ![Processing option](./img/step-4-2.png)

    * **Process the scenario online:** By default, this option is unchecked. When the user selects this option, the scenario is processed online using the API. This means that the system sends the scenario data to a remote server or service via the Internet. The remote server performs the necessary computations or analysis based on the provided scenario data. Processing online allows for real-time analysis and can leverage the computing power and resources available on the remote server. This option might be preferred when the user requires quicker results or when the scenario data is too large or complex to be processed efficiently on the user's local device. However, processing online may require a stable internet connection.
   
    *If the user has previously selected `Online defaults`, this option will be selected automatically.*

4. **Scenario report options:** Below are the benefits of the scenario report options.

    * The Metrics Generator enables plugin users to incorporate additional metrics or calculations for each activity. It includes automated expressions that assist in calculating measures such as irrecoverable carbon, financial metrics like the net present value (NPV) of each activity, and other weighting measures such as jobs per hectare.

    * The tool leverages the full functionality of the expression builder, allowing users to create fully customised expressions based on the available project variables.

    * The Expression Builder within the Metrics Generator has been enhanced with a CPLUS library, which offers automated calculations for irrecoverable carbon, PWL measures, and NPV. These features come with helpful guidance for their use. It is also important to reference the variables list when creating custom options.

    >Note: Please note that expressions can be applied on a column-by-column basis or can be cell-specific, providing full granularity for the measures and metrics associated with each activity.

    ![Scenario Reports Options](./img/step-4-7.png)

    1 **Use custom activity metrics table:** Users must check the checkbox to enable this option. After doing so, they need to click on the ![Builder Icon](./img/step-4-8.png) icon to access the metrics table.
