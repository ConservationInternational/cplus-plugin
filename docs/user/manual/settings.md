# Settings

To go to the settings the user can click on the plugin toolbar icon to reveal the option.

![Toolbar Icon](./img/setting-1.png)

**Setting:** click on the `settings` option to go to the plugin settings. Upon clicking the settings page will open.

![Toolbar Icon](./img/setting-2.png)

1. **CPLUS Dropdown:** Click on the dropdown icon to reveal the Cplus setting options. Click on the `CPLUS` to view the options like general, snapping, sieve, mask layer and trends earth login.

    ![CPLUS options](./img/setting-10.png)

    1 **General:** Click on the `General` option for basic settings such as General, Scenario Analysis, and Sieve settings.

    ![general settings](./img/setting-3.png)

    ## General Settings 

    **Base data directory:** Directory to read data from, and to which results will be written.

    2 **Scenario Analysis Setting:**

    **Coefficient for carbon layers:** Applied to carbon layers during processing.

    **Pathway suitability index:** Index multiplied to the pathways. Lower values means the pathway is less important, and higher means it's more important.

    ## Snapping

    Snapping will set rasters to match the cell alignment of a reference layer.

    ![snapping settings](./img/setting-4.png)

    **Resample method:** Resampling performed on pixel values. The user can choose the method of their choice from the dropdown. The available methods are as follows:

    - *Nearest neighbour*: Closest pixel value. This will be best to use if a user wants to preserve the original pixel values.

    - *Bilinear*: Computes the pixel values from the two closest pixels (2 x 2 kernel).

    - *Cubic*: Computes the pixel values from the four closest pixels (4 x 4 kernel).

    - *Cubic B-Spline*: Cubic resampling based on B-Spline (4 x 4 kernel).

    - *Lanczos*: Lanczos windowed sinc interpolation (6x6 kernel).

    - *Average*: Computes the average of all non-nodata contributing pixels.

    - *Mode*: Select the value that appears most often of all the sampled pixels.

    - *Maximum*: Selects the maximum value which appears of all the sampled pixels.

    - *Minimum*: Selects the minimum value which appears of all the sampled pixels.

    - *Median*: Selects the median value that appears in all the sampled pixels.

    - *First quartile (Q1)*: Select the first quartile value that appears in all the sampled pixels.

    - *Third quartile (Q3)*: Select the third quartile value that appears in all the sampled pixels.

    **Reference layer:** The reference layer to which the cell alignment will be applied. The user can choose a file from the system.

    **Rescale values:** Rescale values according to cell size. The user can check or uncheck.

    ## Sieve Settings

    ![sieve settings](./img/setting-5.png)

    The `Sieve Function` is a tool designed to filter raster data based on a specified threshold. It enables users to define a minimum area threshold, such that any contiguous area in the raster dataset smaller than the specified size will be removed or filtered out.

    This functionality is particularly useful for projects or activities that require a minimum spatial extent to be meaningful or practical. For instance, it might not be feasible to undertake an activity on a parcel of land that is smaller than a certain size, such as a hectare.

    By setting the desired threshold, users can ensure that only areas meeting the specified minimum extent are retained in the dataset, while smaller features are eliminated. This process helps streamline data analysis and ensures that only relevant spatial entities are considered for further processing or analysis.

    The user can use this by checking the checkbox available in front of the `Sieve`.

    **Threshold Size:** Enter the desired threshold value in the Threshold field. This value represents the minimum number of connected pixels that should be preserved when sieving. Any contiguous area smaller than this threshold will be filtered out.

    **Reference Layer:** The reference layer to which the sieve function will be applied. The user can choose the layer from the system.

    To apply the settings user needs to click on the `OK` button.
        
    Click on `Cancel` will close the dialog without applying any changes.

    3 **Mask Layers:**

    **Masking Layers:** Masking layers are used to specify areas that should be excluded from further analysis.

    **Adding a Layer to the Mask:** When the user adds a layer to the mask, they specify that the areas covered by that layer should be excluded from the analysis or processing steps.

    **Exclusion of Layer Area:** By adding a layer to the mask, the user is essentially creating a filter that excludes the areas represented by that layer.

    **Impact on Analysis:** Any analysis or operations performed on the masked data will skip the areas covered by the added layer. This ensures that the analysis focuses only on the relevant geographic features while disregarding the specified layer.

    **Relevance to GIS:** Masking layers play a crucial role in GIS analysis, allowing users to focus on specific areas of interest and filter out irrelevant or undesired features from consideration.

    In summary, adding a layer to the mask in a context allows for the selective exclusion of specific geographic areas from analysis or visualisation, improving the accuracy and relevance of outputs.

    1. **Arrow:** Click on the available `Arrow` button in front of the `Mask Layer` to see the options for adding or deleting the layers from the mask feature.

        ![Mask layer](./img/setting-7.png)

        Upon clicking the user will see the options.

        ![Mask layer options](./img/setting-8.png)

        2. **Plus Icon:** Click on the `Plus` icon, to add the layer to the mask layer from the system. Upon clicking the icon the system will show the available layer, and choose the desired layer to add to the mask layer.

            ![Layers](./img/setting-9.png)

        3. **Minus Icon:** Select the added layer and click on the `Minus` icon, to remove that layer.

        4. **Ok:**  After adding the layer/layers to the mask layer, click on the `OK` button to save the layers in the mask layer and skip them from further analysis.

    4 **Irrecoverable Carbon Reference Layer:**

    The `Irrecoverable Carbon` layer is used in a calculation with the protect pathways to calculate the total irrecoverable carbon per activity.

    ![Irrecoverable Carbon Reference](./img/setting-25.png)
