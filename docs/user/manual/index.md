# Manual

The manual covers two sections. Firstly the workflow will be covered. This includes a discussion on the calculations
and formulas. This is so that a user can understand how the CPLUS processing workflow and calculations for each step is
done when processing the pathways and carbon layers, how the implementations models (IM) are created, algorithms applied to
create the priority weighted layer (weighted IM), and the last step, which is the highest position calculation.

The second section deals with the plugin itself. It covers each step, explains each element of each step and why its
needed. A description of the generated report are also provided.

## CPLUS calculations and formulas

**Figure 1** shows the workflow of the CPLUS model. The workflow can be split into four parts:

- Natural climate solution (NCS) weighted carbon pathway(s)
- Implementation model (IM)
- Priority weighted layer (Weighted IM)
- Highest position (Scenario result)

### NCS weighted carbon

The following steps/rules are considered to create the NCS weighted carbon layer(s):

- Carbon layers:
    - When multiple Carbon layers are provided, the average is calculated from the layers to create a single Carbon layer
    - The produced Carbon layer is multiplied by the Carbon coefficient provided by the user in the settings
    - If the Carbon coefficient is zero, the value is ignored
- NCS pathways:
    - Multiply the pathway raster with the Suitability index
    - If the index is zero, the pathway raster is used as-is
- **Equation 1** shows how the NCS weighted carbon layer is calculated

$$
\operatorname{NCS weighted carbon} ={CarbonCoefficient}\times{\frac{(Carbon_1 + Carbon_2 + .... + Carbon_n)}{n}} + ({SuitabilityIndex}\times{NcsPathway})
$$

*Equation 1: NCS weighted carbon*

where *CarbonCoefficient* is the carbon coefficient value multiplied with the averaged carbon raster;

&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Carbon* is a carbon raster;

&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *SuitabilityIndex* is the NCS pathway index value;

&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *NcsPathway* is the NCS pathway raster; and

&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *n* is the number of carbon rasters.

- The results from the above calculation are normalized to create the normalized NCS Weighted Carbon layer
- A normalized raster's pixel values range from 0 to 1
- Normalization is done as shown in **Equation 2**

$$
\operatorname{Normalized NCS weighted carbon} =\frac{value - min}{max - min}
$$

*Equation 2: Normalized NCS weighted carbon*

where *value* is the pixel value;

&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *min* is the minimum value of the raster; and

&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *max* is the maximum value of the raster.

### Implementation model

- Because an IM can consist of multiple pathways, the normalized results will be summed
- All NCS weighted carbon layers, as created from **Equation 2**, is summed as shown in **Equation 3** to
create the IM from the pathways

$$
\operatorname{Summed pathways} = NcsWeightedCarbon_1 + NcsWeightedCarbon_2 + ... + NcsWeightedCarbon_n
$$

*Equation 3: Summed pathways for the IM*

where *NcsWeightedCarbon* is a pathway set up by the user; and

&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *n* is the number of pathways.

- Now that the pathways has been summed for the IM, the result needs to be normalized
- The Suitability index and the Carbon coefficient then needs to be taken into account after the normalized raster
has been created
- This calculation is shown in **Equation 4**

$$
\operatorname{Final IM} ={(SuitabilityIndex + CarbonCoefficient)}\times{\frac{value - min}{max - min}}
$$

*Equation 4: Final IM created from pathways*

where *value* is the pixel value;

&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *min* is the minimum value of the raster;

&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *max* is the maximum value of the raster;

&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *SuitabilityIndex* is the NCS pathway index value; and

&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *CarbonCoefficient* is the carbon coefficient value multiplied with the averaged carbon raster.

- The resulting output is the final IM

### Priority weighted layer (Weighted IM)

- This step is performed after the IMs has been created
- The PWL is more important, and will therefore be multiplied by five to take this into account
- The PWL weighted is calculated as shown in **Equation 5**

$$
\operatorname{Priority weighted layer} ={FinalImplementationModel} + ({5}\times{Priority weighted layer})
$$

*Equation 5: Priority weighted layer (Weighted IM) calculation*

- The resulting PWL will then be used as input to the Highest position calculation

### Highest Position

The <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/rasteranalysis.html#qgishighestpositioninrasterstack">Highest position</a>
tool determines the raster in a stack with the highest value at a given pixel. Essentially the result
is a classification, where each class represents a specific IM. If multiple rasters has the highest
pixel value at a given pixel, the first raster with that pixel value in the stack will be used.
Figure 2 shows an example from the QGIS description of the Highest position tool.

![QGIS highest position example](img/qgis-highest-position-example.png)

*Figure 2: Highest position example*

In the plugin the nodata values are ignored. This means that if atleast one raster has a pixel value
at that cell there will be a raster stack value. If none of the rasters in the stack has a pixel value
at that cell (e.g. each raster pixel is nodata) the output will be nodata at that pixel.

Here is an explanation on how-to use the **Highest position** tool:

- Figure 3 shows the layer for the Highest position at stack position 1

![QGIS layer 1](img/qgis-hp-stack-layer-1.png)

*Figure 3: Layer 1 used as highest position input*

- Figure 4 shows the layer for the Highest position at stack position 2

![QGIS layer 2](img/qgis-hp-stack-layer-2.png)

*Figure 4: Layer 2 used as highest position input*

- Figure 5 shows the result from the Highest position calculation (Scenario result)
    - *Stack layer 1* (blue): Figure 2 raster had the highest pixel value
    - *Stack layer 2* (red): Figure 3 raster had the highest pixel value

![QGIS highest position result](img/qgis-hp-result.png)

*Figure 5: Highest position result*

This concludes the section on how the calculations is done
