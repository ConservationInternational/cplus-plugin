Step 1 allows a user to set up the scenario details and parameters.

- **Scenario name**: This title will be used throughout the processing, will be used for the groups added to the QGIS canvas, and in the generated report.

- **Scenario description**: A detailed description of the scenario the user will be running. This information will be added to the final report.

- **Extent**: The area of interest (AOI) for analysis. Any spatial data outside this region will be ignored.

- **Map Canvas Extent**: The AOI will be the current extent the user has in QGIS.

- **Draw on Canvas**: Allows the user to manually draw the AOI.

- **Zoom to Pilot Area**: Zooms to the Bushbuckridge pilot study area
