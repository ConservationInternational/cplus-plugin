# Staging version of the plugin

When a pull requested is performed, an automatic staging version is created. This will allow a developer to test their
changes to the plugin with other changes which has not been merged into the main branch. Another advantage of this
approach is to show the client to progress of the plugin.

## Get the staging version

- Download the *cplus_plugin<version>.zip* file if you want to install the plugin in QGIS
- Developers will likely be interested in *Source code (zip)* and *Source code (tar.gz)* options
