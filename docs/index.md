# CPLUS QGIS plugin

## Introduction

The CPLUS QGIS plugin allows users to implement quantitative spatial decision-making when
assessing the best areas in which to implement land uses or land use projects that help to combat
climate change. As there is a working GIS model/prototype of the CPLUS workflow in place, the goal
of the CPLUS QGIS plugin is to automate and systematize this prototype into a standardized and
user-friendly QGIS plugin that can ultimately be used for analysis in any AOI around the globe
