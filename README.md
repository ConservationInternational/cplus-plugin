- From the **Install from ZIP** page, select the zip file and click the **Install** button to install plugin.

##### Plugin Artifacts
The plugin CI workflow generate artifacts each time a new pull request is made against the main branch and 
each time there is a merge into the main branch.

_Comment with a link to the generate plugin zip file artifact_

These artifacts can be used to test the submitted changes before deploying them to the staging repository or
then publishing them to the QGIS official plugin repository.

Pull request artifacts can be accessed from their respective pull request page, under a comment created by a 
`github-actions` bot. Main branch merge artifacts can be viewed and fetched from the plugin site here https://ConservationInternational.github.io/cplus-plugin/administrator/repository

#### Install from custom plugin repository


- Open the QGIS plugin manager, then select the **Settings** page

- Click **Add** button on the **Plugin Repositories** group box and use the above url to create the new plugin repository.

- The plugin should now be available from the list of all plugins that can be installed.

Disable QGIS official plugin repository in order to not fetch plugins from it.

**NOTE:** While the development phase is on going the plugin will be flagged as experimental, make
sure to enable the QGIS plugin manager in the **Settings** page to show the experimental plugins
in order to be able to install it.

When the development work is complete the plugin will be available on the QGIS
official plugin [repository](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins).


### üõ†Ô∏è Development 

To use the plugin for development purposes, clone the repository locally,
install pip, a python dependencies management tool, see https://pypi.org/project/pip/.


Also ensure you are running Python 3.10.x as the `pre-commit` tool is configured to use this specific version.

#### Create virtual environment

Using any python virtual environment manager create project environment. 
Recommending to use [virtualenv-wrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

It can be installed using python pip 

```
pip install virtualenvwrapper
```

 1. Create virtual environment

    ```
    mkvirtualenv cplus
    ```

2. Using the pip, install plugin development dependencies by running 

    ```
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

3. Install an automatic code formatting hook using the following command, 
   this will run code style checks each time a commit is created.
    ```
    pre-commit install
    ```
   Run the following pre-commit command after installing the pre-commit hook
   for the first time.
   ```
    pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

#### Plugin admin interface
The plugin contains a script that can be used for various development tasks.

Install the plugin into the QGIS application, activate virtual environment the use the below command.
```
 python admin.py install
```

Generate a plugin zip file using the below command, after a successful run the plugin zip file will be located
on the `dist` folder under the plugin root folder.

```
python admin.py generate-zip
```

### üîß Testing

The plugin currently support running tests on Linux environment only, to run plugin tests use the below script
from the plugin root.
```
   ./run-tests.sh
```

The script builds a testable plugin code and then it spins up Docker containers that contain QGIS version 3.26 
and latest version images respectively, finally it runs the available test suite. Python is required to
be installed in the system before using the script.

When using the script for the first time it will pull the QGIS Docker images if there are not available 
locally. After the tests have finished running the Docker containers created for the tests will be stopped and removed.
